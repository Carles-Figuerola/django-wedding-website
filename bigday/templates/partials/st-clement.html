            <h3>A bit about Primrose Cottage</h3>
            <p>
                Roswell King, city founder, built Primrose for his daughter, Eliza King Hand, in 1839. Although quite
                grand, Primrose Cottage, Roswell's first permanent home, sits behind a white picket fence that radiates
                a warm ambiance more akin to a cottage than a manor home. The same is true of its impressive landscaping
                designed to capture the essence of an English cottage garden. Embracing the natural lay of the land,
                Primrose and its garden create a magical setting veiled in history, folklore and fantasy.

            <h3>Things to Do</h3>
            <p>For you early arrivers, there's no shortage of things to do in Historic Roswell! Some ideas are listed below.</p>
            <h4>Vickery Creek Trail</h4>
            <p>
                This five-mile adventure explores the historic Roswell Mill and the surrounding rolling forest in
                Roswell, Georgia. It’s one of the best hikes in the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area parks
                near Atlanta, though its trails don’t follow the actual banks of the Chattahoochee River. Instead, this
                hike explores the historic remains of Roswell Mill and visits the mill’s spillway dam waterfall on a
                Chattahoochee River tributary. The 5+ mile trail network hikes through beautiful, rolling forest and
                catches views of the rushing dam waterfall from a steep rock bluff.
            </p>
            <h4>Historic Homes of Roswell Georgia</h4>
            <p>Barrington Hall, Bulloch Hall and Smith Plantation, a trio of antebellum homes, are open to the public
                for visits and exploration. Closely situated as neighbors in the historic town of Roswell, each home
                has its own cultural bounty to share - and its own part of the Southern Trilogy Story - to tell.</p>
            <p>
