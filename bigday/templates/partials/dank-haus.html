            <p class="lang-eng">
                Nestled above educational spaces, art galleries, a library & offices, the Marunde Ballroom illuminates floor 5 of the DANK Haus. This historic gem was built in 1927 & features gilded moldings & old world charm (not to mention our favorite beer on tap: Proust!)
            </p>
            <p class="lang-eng">
                Designed by architect Paul Gehardt, the building came under current use as a German-American cultural center in 1967. The Deutsch Amerikanischer National Kongress (DANK) or “German American National Congress” is located in Chicago’s charming Lincoln Square neighborhood & celebrates German-American heritage through classes, programs & community events. While neither Christine nor Carles have any ties to Germany, we are happy to celebrate our union in this elegant space with it’s multicultural flair & “old world” charm!

            <!--<h3>Things to Do</h3>
            <p>For you early arrivers, there's no shortage of things to do in Historic Roswell! Some ideas are listed below.</p>
            <h4>Vickery Creek Trail</h4>
            <p>
                This five-mile adventure explores the historic Roswell Mill and the surrounding rolling forest in
                Roswell, Georgia. It’s one of the best hikes in the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area parks
                near Atlanta, though its trails don’t follow the actual banks of the Chattahoochee River. Instead, this
                hike explores the historic remains of Roswell Mill and visits the mill’s spillway dam waterfall on a
                Chattahoochee River tributary. The 5+ mile trail network hikes through beautiful, rolling forest and
                catches views of the rushing dam waterfall from a steep rock bluff.
            </p>
            <h4>Historic Homes of Roswell Georgia</h4>
            <p>Barrington Hall, Bulloch Hall and Smith Plantation, a trio of antebellum homes, are open to the public
                for visits and exploration. Closely situated as neighbors in the historic town of Roswell, each home
                has its own cultural bounty to share - and its own part of the Southern Trilogy Story - to tell.</p>
            <p>
