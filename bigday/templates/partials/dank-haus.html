            <p class="lang-eng">
            The Deutsch Amerikanischer National Kongress (DANK) or “German American National Congress” is a non-profit dedicated to promoting German-American culture. Located in Chicago’s charming Lincoln Square neighborhood, DANK offers classes, programs & community events which celebrate German heritage. This historic building was designed by architect Paul Gehardt & built in 1927. Our reception will be on the 5th floor in the lovely Marunde Ballroom.

            While neither Christine nor Carles have any ties to Germany, we are happy to celebrate our union in this elegant space with its multicultural flair & “old world” charm!
