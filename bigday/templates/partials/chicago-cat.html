                        Must see, it’s downtown in Millennium Park. This sculpture from the beginning of this century reflects Chicago’s skyline from the heart of Millenium Park. It’s right next to Crown Fountain and The Jay Pritzker Pavillion which are also nice sights. See it being built <a href=”https://imgur.com/a/4Bz8B”>here</a>

                    <td>
                        Best views of the city but they come at a cost. Long lines and high prices might not be worth them. They have protruding windows so you can "walk on air" but everything else looks (and is) a tourist trap. See "The Signature Lounge" on the Hancock Tower below for something similar that's more low key.

                                This is arguably the better of them as it’s volunteers that love architecture that explain the city. It doesn’t run as late/early months as the others but it’s the recommended one

                                Both Wendella and Shoreline do Tours that include multi-lingual headphones but are arguably not as good as the ones from the CAF.

                        It's just here because you'll find it in most travel guides. It's super touristy and cheesy, avoid it at all costs.

                        The Lakefront Trail that is an extremely nice bike path that goes all the way north and south from Chicago between the city and the lake. Get a bike (there are several bike rental places next to Navy Pier) and go up to Castaways or Montrose beach and down to Adler Planetarium (you have to get off the trail next to Shedd Aquarium and get on the street to get to Adler). Adler planetarium has the best views of the skyline, highly recommended to go there, and it gets way better at night time.
